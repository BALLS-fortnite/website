                </div>
                <!-- review -->
                <div>
                    <p>Kanye West's "The College Dropout" is a masterpiece. One of the standout tracks, "All Falls
                        Down," encapsulates the struggles of life and self-identity with a blend of him showing his
                        honesty and vulnerability.<br><br>

                        From the very first note, the song's mellow, introspective melody draws you in. The opening
                        lines, paints a vivid picture of societal pressures and the facades we put on to meet those
                        expectations. The line "She couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis" sets the
                        stage for a narrative that exposes the sisyphean pursuit of materialism in our society and its
                        negatives on our self-esteem.

                        Kanye's lyrical genius shines as he touches on themes of self-worth & societal hypocrisy. He
                        speaks to the universal experience of chasing appearances, even when it means sacrificing
                        authenticity. The line "We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it" is a powerful
                        acknowledgment of everyone's shared insecurities and the relief that can come from acknowledging
                        them.<br><br>

                        What truly elevates the song's quality is its emotional weight. The lyrics talk about how
                        societal status won't shield us from discrimination. It's the cold harsh truth delivered through
                        a gentle melody, showing his ability to show how he can mix complex melodies with complex
                        themes.

                        It isn't just a song. It's a mirror reflecting our societal struggles & aspirations. Kanye
                        West's ability to show these problems in his songs sets him as a mouldbreaker that ups the
                        standards of lyrical play in music.</p>

                    <h3>Bound 2</h3>
                </div>
                <!-- review -->
                <div>
                    <p>Kanye West's "Yeezus" album is a polarizing masterpiece that defies conventional expectations of
                        hip-hop and challenges listeners with its unapologetically experimental sound. "Bound 2" emerges
                        is a surprising outlier, a raw and introspective gem that offers a moment of respite amidst the
                        album's abrasive tracks.<br><br>

                        "Bound 2" immediately strikes a contrast to the rest of "Yeezus." The song's soulful sample,
                        borrowed from Brenda Lee's "Sweet Nothin's," introduces a nostalgic and warm atmosphere, a stark
                        departure from the harsh industrial beats that dominate the rest of the album. Kanye's lyrics,
                        while maintaining his characteristic bravado, also dive into personal vulnerability as he
                        reflects on love, relationships, and the complexities of fame.

                        The song's production is a testament to Kanye's ability to blend genres. The contrast of the
                        classic sample with modern hip-hop elements creates a unique song that's simultaneously old and
                        new. The airy choral background and the rhythmic guitar strums provide an almost cinematic
                        quality, allowing the listener to be transported to a different space, far removed from the
                        album's aggressive aesthetic.

                        The highlight of "Bound 2" is undeniably its chorus. The now-iconic refrain "I know you're tired
                        of loving, of loving, with nobody to love" resonates deeply, encapsulating a sentiment of
                        longing and the challenges of maintaining a meaningful connection in a world that can feel
                        isolating. Kanye's flow here is effortless, giving his emotions the room they need to
                        breathe.<br><br>

                        "Bound 2" stands out on "Yeezus" as a moment of introspection in a sea of provocative
                        experimentation. Its contrast to the rest of the album emphasizes Kanye's range as an artist,
                        showcasing his willingness to explore different areas of music. Bound 2 and the album has stood
                        the time entirely as it was a peak into music in the future which is shown now through its
                        influence on Travis Scott's album "Utopia".</p>

                </div>
                <!-- review -->
                <div>
                    <p>"Last Call," the closing track of Kanye West's debut album "The College Dropout," stands as a
                        captivating introspection into the artist's journey. Spanning over twelve minutes, the song
                        unfolds as a candid and unfiltered monologue, shedding light on the highs and lows that paved
                        the way for Kanye's ascent to musical prominence. <br><br>

                        With a stripped-down musical backdrop that mirrors the rhythm of a moving train, Kanye's
                        spoken-word delivery draws the listener into an intimate dialogue. Through vivid anecdotes, he
                        recounts the problems he faced in his pursuit of a record deal, confronting rejection and doubt
                        head-on. His willingness to expose vulnerabilities underscores the authenticity of his
                        narrative.

                        The heart of "Last Call" lies in Kanye's recollection of his pivotal meeting with Jay-Z and his
                        signing to Roc-A-Fella Records. This turning point signifies not only professional achievement
                        but also a validation of his artistic vision. Kanye's voice carries a mix of gratitude,
                        excitement, and nostalgia as he relives the moment, offering a glimpse into his triumph.

                        What makes "Last Call" truly exceptional is its extended duration, a rarity in today's music
                        landscape. Yet, this length is essential to the track's impact. Straying from traditional song
                        structure, Kanye crafts a conversation that's both engaging and informative. The absence of a
                        traditional chorus allows his story to flow organically, lending an immersive quality to his
                        narrative.

                        By sharing his imperfections and struggles, Kanye demonstrates that the journey to success is
                        paved with determination and sacrifice. <br><br>

                        "Last Call" is more than just a song; it's a homage to the artistic process, a reminder of the
                        resilience required to overcome challenges, and a testament to the enduring power of creative
                        passion.

                        In the tapestry of Kanye's discography, "Last Call" stands as a masterpiece of vulnerability and
                        storytelling. As listeners, we're granted a front-row seat to his evolution, reminding us that
                        even the most iconic artists are human, with narratives shaped by both triumph and tribulation.

                </div>
                <!-- review -->
                <div>
                    <p>"Ghost Town," a standout track from Kanye West's album "ye," shows ideas of exploration, freedom,
                        individuality, and the haunting struggle to be truly authentic. With a blend of haunting vocals
                        by Kid Cudi and 070 Shake, the song dives into the yearning to break free from societal
                        constraints.

                        The song's production, featuring a diverse fusion of rock, gospel, and hip-hop elements, creates
                        a mesmerizing backdrop for its emotional journey. The contrast between raw, unfiltered vocals
                        and meticulously crafted instrumentals adds depth, drawing listeners into an experience that's
                        both intimate and grand.<br><br>

                        "Ghost Town" takes on a paradoxical quality, pairing melancholic lyrics with an anthemic and
                        uplifting arrangement. This dichotomy mirrors the complexity of the human experience and
                        yearning for liberation while acknowledging the internal battles that accompany it. The repeated
                        refrain "I feel kinda free" captures the essence of breaking away from the metaphorical "ghost
                        town" of conformity and embracing individuality.

                        The track's resonance is heightened by its context within Kanye's discography and personal
                        struggles. It's as if he's opening up a dialogue about embracing imperfections and the search
                        for truth. "Ghost Town" becomes a rallying cry for authenticity, urging listeners to reflect on
                        their own journeys within a world often marred by disconnection.<br><br>

                        "Ghost Town" stands as a testament to Kanye's artistry and his ability to create songs that
                        resonate on emotional and intellectual levels. It's an eerie yet liberating anthem that speaks
                        to the universal pursuit of finding oneself amidst the echoes of a fading societal facade.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>"24," a standout track from Kanye West's "Donda" album, emerges as a soulful song showing themes
                        of legacy, family, and spirituality. "24" showcases Kanye's ability to blend introspection with
                        his signature sound.<br><br>

                        The song's title carries weight, symbolizing the 24 hours we all have in a
                        day it's a reminder of the preciousness of time. The gospel-inspired vocals, provided by West's
                        Sunday Service Choir, evoke a sense of spiritual reflection. The choir's harmonies create a
                        transcendent atmosphere, inviting us into a moment of collective introspection.

                        "24" is more than just a song. Kanye's verses touch on themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and his
                        role as a father. He reflects on his journey and the challenges he's faced, often under the
                        scrutiny of the public eye. This vulnerability humanizes him, giving us a glimpse of the man
                        behind the persona.

                        The song's production is lush, with a mix of gospel and hip-hop elements that encapsulates
                        Kanye's genre-blurring approach. The piano chords and choir's soaring vocals provide a rich
                        backdrop for Kanye's introspective musings. The melody sways between uplifting and
                        contemplative, creating a balance that resonates with the song's themes.<br><br>

                        "24" is a testament to the power of transformation and redemption. It encapsulates Kanye's own
                        evolution, a journey from the tumultuous to the serene. The closing lines, with Kanye expressing
                        gratitude for his family, particularly his mother Donda, encapsulate the heart of the album it's
                        a tribute to growth, resilience, and the enduring bond of family.

                        experiences and spiritual journey. The song invites us to reflect on their own lives, their
                        relationships, and the legacy they wish to leave behind. With its blend of spirituality,
                        introspection, and musical brilliance, "24" is a testament to Kanye's ability to create music
                        that not only resonates but also inspires introspection and connection.</p>
